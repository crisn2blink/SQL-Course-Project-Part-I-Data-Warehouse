## Part II: EDA

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries. This project was done as part of a SQL masterclass (Data with Baraa). The documents provided are his creations and form the base of this project.

## Part II Requirements

### Performing EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Objective

Perform EDA using the output of Part I (the gold layer business views) to gain general business insights and to begin shaping the blueprint for the dashboard created in Part III

- **Data Sources**: gold layer business views

<br>

**STEPS**

- Run the 10 EDA queries and record the results
- Summarize the results in a one-page document (summary page)

<br>

🧰**SKILLS DEMONSTRATED**🧰

- Data Analysis
- EDA
- Critical Thinking
- Understanding of Business Operations

## 🎯 EDA Analysis Breakdown

1. **Dimension Exploration:**
    - Identify the unique values (or categories) in each dimension
    - Recognizing how data might be grouped or segmented, which is useful for later analysis
    - Understanding the granularity of our dimensions as well as the hierarchical layers

  

2. **Date Exploration**: Find the dates for the range of orders
    - Identify the earliest and latest dates (boundaries)
    - Understand the time-span

  

Syntax:

MIN/MAX \[date dimensions\]

  

3. **Measure Exploration**
    - Calculate and find out the key metrics of our business (Big Numbers)
    - Highest level of aggregation/lowest level of details

  

Examples:

- SUM(Sales)
- AVG(price)
- SUM(quantity)
- COUNT(DISTINCT customer\_key)

  

4. **Magnitude Analysis**
    - Here we will start putting things together and really begin our analysis (this is basic).
    - Magnitude analysis is comparing the measure values **by categories**.
    - Helps us to understand the importance of different categories.

  

Scenarios:

- Total sales by country
- Total quantity by category
- Average price by products
- Total orders by customers

  

5. **Ranking Analysis**
    - Order the values and dimensions by measures
    - Top performers|Bottom performers

  

Examples:

- RANK \[dimension\] by \[measure\]
- RANK countries by total\_sales
- TOP 5 products by quantity
- BOTTOM 3 customers by total\_sales

  

6. **Change Over Time**  
    - Technique to analyze how a measure evolves over time
    - Helps to track trends and identify seasonality

  

Scenarios:

- Total sales by year
- Average cost by month

  

7. **Cumulative Analysis**: Running total & Moving Average
    - Used to aggregate the data progressively across time
    - Helps to understand whether our business is growing or declining
    - Very similar to change over time but cumulative

  

Case Use:

- Aggregate \[cumulative measure\] By \[date dimension\]

  

8. **Performance Analysis (YoY Analysis)**
    - Process of comparing the current value with a target value. 

  

Case Use:

- Current\[measure\] - Target\[measure\]

  

Scenarios:

- Current sales - Average sales
- Current year sales - previous year sales
- Current sales - lowest sales
- Highest sales - Current sales

  

9. **Part-to-Whole Analysis**
    - Proportional Analysis: Analyze how an individual part is performing compared to the overall, allowing us to understand which category has the greatest impact on the business.

  

Case Use:

- (\[measure\]/Total \[measure\]) \* 100 BY \[dimension\]

  

Examples:

- (Sales/Total Sales) \* 100 By Category
- (Quantity/Total Quantity) \* 100 By Country

  

10. **Data Segmentation Analysis**
    - Group the data based on a specific range
    - Helps to understand the correlation between two measures

  

Case Use:

- \[Measure\] by \[Measure\]

  

Scenarios:

- Total products By Sales Range
- Total customers By Age
