# AdventureWorks Business Intelligence Dashboard

Welcome to the **Project** repository! This is a three-part project that demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solutions, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights through the creation of a business-intelligence dashboard. Designed as a portfolio project that highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

Data is from 2010 to 2014

<br>

THREE PARTS TO THE PROJECT

1. Part I: ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) Data Pipeline Creation
2. Part II: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3. Part III: Power BI Dashboard

<br>

## 🧭 How to Navigate this Repository

After reading the entirety of this very short README page to understand how the project is segmented, please feel free to proceed to Part I of this three part project via the folder titled:

- 01-etl-data-pipeline

<br>

Make sure to once again read the full README found within this folder and navigate through the folders inquisitively.

<br>

Once Part I has been covered, proceed in the same manner (making sure to read the README document in each Part folder) for the following two folders:

- 02-eda
- 03-dashboard

<br>
Ultimately, this will provide a clear picture of the overall project and will also highlight my abilities as a business analyst and data engineer (which is the entire point of this portfolio project).

## Project Requirements

### Part I: Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering) & Pipeline

Tools used: SSMS

Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications

- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

<br>

### Part II: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Tools used: SSMS

#### Objective

Perform initial EDA using the business objects (gold layer views) created in Part I to:

- Begin to understand general business KPIs.
- Understand the data and get a general snapshot of company performance.
- Begin aggregating information to build the business dashboard with.

<br>

### Part III: BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

Tools used: Power BI

#### Objective

Develop Power BI dashboard based on Part II EDA results to deliver detailed business insights into:

- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
